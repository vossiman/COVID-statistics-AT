## How to start hacking

### Prerequisites

You'll need Python &gte; 3.7 (we are using `@dataclass` introduced in that version).

### Now start hacking!

Type `./run startup`. You are set.

### More helpful commands?

Type `./run help` or simply `./run`. If you don't like typing the `./` part, make sure `.` is in your `$PATH` variable, e.g. by typing `PATH=.:$PATH`.
